As a compensation to sitting in front of my computer for ~ 60 hours a week I keep some really cool reptiles as a hobby.

To keep track on how to properly care for my reptiles I follow some really great youtube channels. One of them is
B.E.A.R. Blakes Exotic Animal Ranch. On the 03.11.2021 Blakes dropped this video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fke_qd2EabQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I heard about aquaponics before but didn't take a closer look into it until I saw Blakes video. I have two alligator
snapping turtles toghether with a bunch of guppies in my 1'000l indoor pond that currently holdes about 300l. As well
as a 400l Malawi tank. I've to replace at least 50% of the water in the Malawi tank every 7 to 10 days. I have to change
~25% of the water in the alligator snapper tank about every 14 day. Normally I can use about half the "waste" water for
my plants. I also added epipremnum aureum to my alligator snapper tank in order to lower the nitrate level. Still
I've a lot of "waste" water every week. It also is a pain in the neck to make all this water changes that often.  
After I saw Blakes video I started to inform me a lil bit more about aquaponics and took the plan to build my own small
system. The first thing to figure out was: Which tank should I first extend or connect to aquaponics cycle?  
My alligator snappers and guppies are pretty tougth and can take spikes in the water quality. Therefore it was clear for
me to start a aquaponics system with my alligator snappers and guppies. Now I've to decide where my system should stand.
I decided to place it at the window front of my reptile room where my alligator snapper tank is.  
At next I made some drawing based on the many many youtube videos I've watched about aquaponics :-)

This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.

We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

[^1]: Beautiful modern, minimal theme design.
[^2]: Powerful features to show off your work.
[^3]: Maintained and supported by the theme developer.

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/203710832" width="640" height="288" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
